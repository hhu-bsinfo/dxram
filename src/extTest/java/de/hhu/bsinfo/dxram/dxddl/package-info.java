package de.hhu.bsinfo.dxram.dxddl;

/**
 * This package contains automatically generated java files from the dxddl-compiler.
 * The purpose is to test the generated DXDDL-API for the direct memory access.
 *
 * Please find *.dxddl source files in resources/ directory.
 * This files are the source for the generated java files.
 *
 * The test files are human written.
 * That way if any critical change happen in DXRAM, the test will catch this case.
 * On the other hand, when the transpiler is updated, please regenerate the java API code
 * and adjust the tests if necessary.
